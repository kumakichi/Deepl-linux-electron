* Troubleshooting

** ubuntu 24.04 core dump

   Error message likes:
   #+begin_quote
   The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /dev/shm/tmpdir/.mount_Deepl-iCQgY6/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
   #+end_quote

   just run with parameter:
   #+begin_src sh
     ./Deepl-Linux-Electron-1.5.0.AppImage --no-sandbox
   #+end_src
